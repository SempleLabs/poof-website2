QuickBooks Online has been the go-to bookkeeping solution for small businesses for years. But is it still the best choice in 2025? Let's compare QuickBooks Online with Poof to help you make an informed decision.

## The Core Difference: Automation vs. Software

The fundamental difference between these platforms comes down to philosophy:

**QuickBooks Online** gives you powerful tools to do your bookkeeping. You're still doing the work, you just have better software to do it with.
